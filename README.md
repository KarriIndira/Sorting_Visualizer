# Sorting_Visualizer
A sorting visualizer is an interactive tool that helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work. It typically displays a set of data elements, such as  bars, and allows users to select a sorting algorithm to apply to the data. The visualizer then animates the sorting process, showing how the elements are compared and swapped until they are in the desired order.

Sorting visualizers are valuable tools for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning about algorithms. They provide a visual representation of the sorting process, which can be difficult to grasp from textual descriptions alone. By watching the animation, users can gain a deeper understanding of how the algorithm works and how it compares to other sorting algorithms.
